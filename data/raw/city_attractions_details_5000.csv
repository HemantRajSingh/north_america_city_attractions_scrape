Once you feel comfortable you can choose to move up and down the field and try farther and closer distances to test your accuracy. Once you become more precise at hitting the targets and shooting the arrows you can upgrade to a more advanced bow with more advanced heavier arrows. It gets fun to test yourself and see if you can hit the targets at a further distance.
